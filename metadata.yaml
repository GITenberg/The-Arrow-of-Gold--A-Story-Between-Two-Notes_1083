description: "The Arrow of Gold is a novel by Joseph Conrad, published in 1919. It\
  \ was originally titled \"The Laugh\" and published serially in Lloyd's Magazine\
  \ from December 1918 to February 1920. The story is set in Marseille in the 1870s\
  \ during the Third Carlist War. The characters of the novel are supporters of the\
  \ Spanish Pretender Carlos, Duke of Madrid. Curiously, the novel features a person\
  \ referred to as \"Lord X\", whose activities as arms smuggler resemble those of\
  \ the Carlist politician Tirso de Olazábal y Lardizábal, Count of Arbelaiz.\nThe\
  \ narrator of The Arrow of Gold has considerable involvement in the story and is\
  \ unnamed, though some assume he is Conrad's regular narrator, Charles Marlow. The\
  \ principal theme is a love triangle which comprises the young narrator, Doña Rita\
  \ and the Confederate veteran Captain Blunt (named for Simon F. Blunt. Doña Rita\
  \ finances the operations of the narrator's vessel, Tremolino which smuggles ammunition\
  \ to the Carlist army. Nautical operations are detailed in the Tremolino chapters\
  \ of The Mirror of the Sea rather than in this novel.\nConrad dedicated the novel\
  \ to his friend and literary assistant Richard Curle.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
